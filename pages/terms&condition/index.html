            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Application of Terms</h3>
                    <p>These terms and conditions (“T&Cs” or “Agreement”) apply to any social media community moderation and/or management services and related services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by ICUC/iProspect Moderation Services, Inc. or its affiliates (“Agency” or “ICUC”) to the client (the “Client”) pursuant to or in connection with the statement of work, order form, estimate, invoice or other document to which these T&Cs are attached, or which references these T&Cs (collectively, the “Schedules”). To the extent of any conflict between these T&Cs and any Schedule, priority shall be given to these T&Cs, except to the extent a Schedule expressly states that it is intended to prevail over a specific provision of these T&Cs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Services Fees</h3>
                    <p>During the term of this Agreement, Client shall pay to Agency the fees and expenses (collectively the “Services Fees”) as set forth in the applicable Schedule or otherwise agreed upon in writing. Unless specified otherwise in writing in the applicable Schedule, Client shall pay the Services Fees to Agency no later than 30 days after the applicable invoice date from Agency, as instructed by Agency. Client shall be responsible for all taxes in connection with the Services (excluding taxes based on Agency’s net income). All invoices shall be deemed accepted unless disputed in good faith within 10 days after receipt thereof. If an invoice is disputed, Client shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice when due. Late payments shall accrue interest daily following the due date at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law. Agency reserves the right (without limiting its other rights or remedies) to suspend all Services in the event of late payment. Client shall also pay to Agency all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in collection of any delinquent amounts.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Cancellations</h3>
                    <p>Client may request Agency to cancel or amend any schedules or work in progress forming part of the Services. Agency will use reasonable efforts to comply with any such request provided that Agency is able to do so within its contractual obligations to third parties. In the event of any such cancellation or amendment, Client shall promptly pay to Agency: (a) Agency’s Services Fees covering the cancelled or amended Services (calculated on a pro rata basis for the period up to the effective date of cancellation or amendment); (b) any charges, expenses or additional costs paid or payable by Agency in relation to the cancellation or amendment (including without limitation retrospective rate adjustments, cancellation charges or lower discounts from third parties); and (c) any cancellation fee specified in the applicable Schedule.</p>
